An aid in manually converting Reaper's JSFX (interpreted code)to C++.

| ./jsfx2cpp.py -f jsfx-samples/real-jsfx | clang-format --style LLVM

It generates a class of almost valid C++ code as a starting point of a JSFX to
C++ porting effort.

This is a personal tool, coded for fun. I'm not trained as a computer scientist
and it's the first time of me coding some (na√Æve, kindof) compiler. Expect this
to show. It is almost sure for some things to be possible to be done in a better
way.

My plans were to convert some JSFX to C++ with it afterwards, but I lost steam
after buying lots of audio plugins on Black Friday and Christmas. So I share
this code in case someone finds it useful.

In the current status, if I remember correctly, I was that is is able to parse
complex JSFX programs (e.g. Saike's) and the sources looked good, but I never
tested integrating the generated code to JUCE.

I was about to implement an optimization pass to try to convert chained if/else
statements to switches and then try to port some FX.

The codebase has Proof of concept code quality. It could use some refactors here
and there:

* No unit testing.
* Total disregard for speed/efficiency. Favoring code clarity.
* Not a lot of documentation etc..
* Coding on a big file.
* The error output could be improved

Deliberate known issues/omissions:

* "this.." not implemented, just "this.".
* strings.

Non-deliberate known issues/omissions:

* Only single function namespaces. E.g. fn(namespace*). The current
  implementation is based on substituting by "this" and namespace calls when
  possible. This JSFX features was found very late on the development cycle
  after successfully parsing  many non-trivial JSFX scripts. It is a non
  documented a seldomly used feature.

* Another feature I found very late. On JSFX calling a function with less
  parameters than the function expects succeeds by defaulting missing parameters
  to 0. I didn't even bother checking parameter counts as I was assuming that
  correct JSFX code would never do that. Just add explicit 0's for missing
  parameterson the generated code.

* Comments are a bit flaky. If some file doesn't work because of the comments
  just temporarily remove them. PLY uses regexes for lexing, which doesn't play
  well. This could just be fixed by doing it on the preprocessing stage. At some
  point it could be interesting for the source's comments to make it to the
  generated code.
