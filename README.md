An aid in manually converting Reaper's JSFX (interpreted code)to C++.

| ./jsfx2cpp.py -f jsfx-samples/real-jsfx | clang-format --style LLVM

It generates a class of almost valid C++ code as a starting point of a JSFX to
C++ porting effort.

This is a personal tool, coded for fun. I'm not trained as a computer scientist
and it's the first time of me coding some (na√Æve, kindof) compiler. Expect this
to show. It is almost sure for some things to be possible to be done in a better
way.

My plans were to convert some JSFX to C++ with it afterwards, but I lost steam
after buying lots of audio plugins on Black Friday and Christmas. So I share
this code in case someone finds it useful.

In the current status, if I remember correctly, I was that is is able to parse
complex JSFX programs (e.g. Saike's) and the sources looked good, but I never
tested integrating the generated code to JUCE.

I was about to implement an optimization pass to try to convert chained if/else
statements to switches and then try to port some FX.

The codebase has Proof of concept code quality. It could use some refactors here
and there:

* No unit testing.
* Total disregard for speed/efficiency. Favoring code clarity.
* Not a lot of documentation etc..
* Coding on a big file.
* The error output could be improved
